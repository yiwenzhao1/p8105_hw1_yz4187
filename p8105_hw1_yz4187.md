### Problem 1

This problem is intended to emphasize variable types and introduce
coercion; some awareness of how R treats numeric, character, and factor
variables is necessary for working with these data types in practice.

``` r
learning_df = 
  tibble(
    sample = rnorm(10),
    gr_than_0 = sample > 0,
    vec_char = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("1","2","3","1","2","3","1","2","3","1"))
  )



mean(pull(learning_df, var = 1))
```

    ## [1] 0.09150891

``` r
mean(pull(learning_df, var = 2))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(pull(learning_df, var = 3))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(learning_df, var = 3)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(learning_df, var = 4))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(learning_df, var = 4)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

-   The means of “sample” and “gr\_than\_0” can work, but the means for
    “vec\_char” and “vec\_factor” can not work.

``` r
as.numeric(levels(learning_df))
```

-   According to the as.numeric function, we can see that the mean for
    colume “vec\_char” and “vec\_fator” are “N/A” since they are not
    numbers. The as.numeric function helps to show which colume is not
    able to transfer to numeric. Since these two columes are not
    numbers, we can not get the means.
